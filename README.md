# Pomodoro App with React Native

There are two reasons for developing this project. First, is a proof of concept. In this project, I use React Native, Redux and many other packages, although some packages provide more complex solutions to certain problems, I wanted to try those technologies. Second, I had a hard time finding a simple and just a pomodoro counter on Google Play.

<div>
     <img src="./assets/release-images/image-dark-main.png"
          alt="Image dark - main" 
          />
     <img src="./assets/release-images/image-dark-settings.png"
          alt="Image dark - settings" 
          />
</div>
